                <p  style="text-indent: 40px">The world is becoming a very interesting place with the advent of COVID accelerating many old trends and creating some new ones along the way. The mass adoption of online services in favor of the more brick-and-mortar alternatives is one of the old trends that COVID accelerated a little ahead of schedule according to many experts. The seemingly new and more sizeable audience that did not fully know how to guard themselves online has attracted a generation of new cybercriminals. </P>
<br>
	 <p  style="text-indent: 40px"> One of the most common forms of cyber crimes that modern cybercriminals perpetuate more after COVID would be the perpetuating use of ransomware. One of the most prolific ransomware families that have emerged from this new trend of ransomware is Clop. 
</p><br>
	<p  style="text-indent: 40px">Clop has reportedly affected over 130 victims in the past 2 months. The developers behind Clop have claimed to take advantage of a previously unknown zero-day exploit in a popular file transfer service. The File Transfer service in question is called GoAnywhere made by Fortra. The attack was not as widespread as the other attacks that happened in the past year as the file transfer service was not a common tool to all businesses. However,  many high-ticket companies were affected such as Proctor & Gamble and Virgin Group. Some governmental institutions were affected by the attack such as the U.K. Pension Protection fund. Even Rubrik, a secure data recovery service, was affected by the ransomware attack. 
</p><br>
<p  style="text-indent: 40px">However, this is not the first time that Clop has successfully carried out ransomware attacks against high-profile targets. Clop was used to attack several firms in the United States and South Korea resulting in payouts exceeding USD 500 million in 2021. Among the most notable victims of the attack is the large South Korean e-commerce firm, E-Land. South Korea was one of the most attacked countries by Clop ransomware attacks during the period between 2018 to 2020. Interestingly the attacks then were based out of Ukraine, and the US and the South Korean governments worked together to catch the perpetrators. 
</p><br>
<p  style="text-indent: 40px">Clop itself is a ransomware that first evolved from another ransomware family called CrytoMix. and the first group that was discovered to use Clop was called TA505 during a large-scale spear-fishing email campaign. Clop is usually credited to be an example of RaaS or ransomware as a service that is usually considered to have a Russian origin. The ransomware is also historically known to use a verified and digitally signed binary that made it look like a legitimate executable file. Another interesting fact about this ransomware is that it targets a victimâ€™s whole network rather than specific computers on the network. Clop has been so successful and prolific in the many attacks that it was utilized for that it is now considered a trendsetter among modern ransomware. 
</p><br>
<p  style="text-indent: 40px">In conclusion, the ransomware Clop seems to be in a long line of ransomware that is used to take advantage of the cybersecurity weaknesses of large organizations, particularly through the mode of phishing emails. Since this ransomware is considered a trendsetter many cybersecurity officers may want to consider looking for malicious scripts on the other computers in the network besides the infected system.
