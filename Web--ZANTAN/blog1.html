                <p  style="text-indent: 40px">Kids have been hooked on many different animated shows over the years from Super Friends (1973) to the more recent anime series within the past few years.</P>
<br>
	 <p  style="text-indent: 40px"> A particular anime series has been of particular note in recent years. The series in question is called “Naruto” and the series itself does not have anything to do with malware or cyber security. It has now been connected to one of the most recent botnets called by the Akamai institute the “Hinatabot” through the name of Hinata who is a character in the series. 
</p><br>
	<p  style="text-indent: 40px">Quite the opposite in fact the cartoon series, “Naruto,” is a show about cartoon ninjas with seemingly magical powers that allow them to manipulate the elements. The environment also does not seem to have any sort of computer system, moreover, it is hinted that the only technology used in the original series is similar to modern walkie-talkies. The series highlights the lack of technological improvement by implying that the industrial revolution has not happened yet for the inhabitants of the world through the lack of trains and the need for each character to travel long distances on foot jumping through impossibly large trees. However, we all know that the source material doesn't matter for the creative to apply it elsewhere. 
</p><br>
<p  style="text-indent: 40px">The Botnet is based on the programming language of Go, which is a  language that was made to possess the “good” traits of several other languages like python and C++. The language itself was developed by Google employees. Some of the focuses of the language include: increasing developer productivity and somehow making better use of networking applications of code. The language also has the advantage of having an adorable mascot, an anthropomorphic gopher. The language is also open-source which has led to other threat actors making other malicious scripts to attack any company that uses this language. The language is used by any corporation that uses google products for any facet of their business. 
</p><br>
<p  style="text-indent: 40px">The Hinatabot has great capabilities in Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (or DDoS) and is capable of taking advantage of specific weaknesses of the Go language. The flaws that were exploited by the malware at the akamai servers were found to be the CVE-2014-8361 flaw and the CVE-2017-17215 flaw. These flaws were also used by the Mirai malware which the experts at Akamai say that the Hinatabot is a descendant of. One mode of attack for the malware is SSH ports through HTTP and UDP protocols, in true DDoS style, however, it can also infect systems through other means such as using infection scripts. The Hinatabot then quietly runs and awaits commands from the threat actor on the command and control server. Amusingly, the author of Hinatabot has reflected the storyline of the character of Hinata in the commands used to interact with the malware. Akamai also warns that the script is still under development and it has greater potential to do more harm.
</p><br>
<p  style="text-indent: 40px">In conclusion, anyone using the Go language for any aspect of their work should be very watchful of the progress made by the author of the Hinatabot as the future is uncertain. The malware may follow the path of its namesake character who went from an underdog to a professional.
