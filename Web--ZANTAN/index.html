        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Ahmed!</h2>
        <p>
I’ve always had a fascination with the information technology industry in all the various roles that I have taken over my 40 years of working. I started off in the construction industry as a Brick Mason and worked my way up to Site Manager, then I went on to go to the Printing industry where I experienced some success as well starting as a Sales Representative to my final destination as a C-Suite Executive. Now I am finally back to my original passion and interest in an industry related to Information technology called “Cyber Security.” As a result I finally decided to become a part of the Cybersecurity community.

                <h4>Malware, Botnet, Hinatabot, Cartoon</h4>
                <p>The trend of hackers using movie references now seems to have shifted to cartoons. A new malware has been named Hinatabot by Akamai institute due to the author naming the script Hinata after the namesake character in an animated TV show called “Naruto.” Hinatabot has been shown to be able to take advantage of some vulnerabilities in the Go programming language.

                <h4>Ransomware, Clop, Trendsetter, E-Commerce</h4>
                <p>
One of the more interesting effects of COVID on the world is the sharp increase in cybercrime, especially the use of malicious scripts such as ransomware. One of the most dangerous of these ransomware families is called Clop. Clop has a prolific history of being able to take advantage of unknown zero-day vulnerabilities, the most recent of which was found in a file transfer service by Fortra. Clop is also known to infect a victim’s entire network rather than a single computer.
